## Application-specific domain lists

Each application listed here has two sets of files.

Files with the suffix `.blocklist` contain a list of domains that should be blocked in order to prevent the application being used.

Files with the suffix `.allowlist` contain a list of domains that need to be allowed for the application to be full usable if everything else is blocked.
