## Platform-specific domain lists

Each platform listed here has two sets of files.

Files with the suffix `.blacklist` contain a list of domains that should be blocked in order to prevent the service being used.

Files with the suffix `.whitelist` contain a list of domains that need to be whitelisted for the service to be full usable if everything else is blocked.
