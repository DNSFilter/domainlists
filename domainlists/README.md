This is a list of domains associated with top websites. It was compiled with comprehensiveness in mind and thus errs on the side of blocking too much instead of too little.

Tools used to source these lists:

Using https://crt.sh to run a wildcard "%.domain.com" search for certificates which yielded some subdomains

Running a VirusTotal search like https://www.virustotal.com/#/domain/youtube.com which yields observed subdomains
